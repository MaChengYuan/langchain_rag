## Project Description
The notebook aims at showcase of intellectual system with langchain framework. It show complete workflow of retrival augmentation generation from data-retrieval of outer resource, rarank, prompting to response generation. 

## Reason and Motivation
1. To practice the langchain framework
2. To test different embedding model and chat model for our purpose : RAG pipeline for convesation with knowledge in specific website
3. To deploy the reranker with sentence-transformer and different prompt like chain-of-thought to better understand and respond the given questions

## Technologies
